My Master Thesis on Analyzing Slot and Intent Detection for Upper German Dialects via Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

The project also includes a new test and validation set for Bavarian (Munich region dialect) - parallel to the dataset by Winkler et. al. (Upper Bavarian) accessible via xSID-5.0 by van der Goot et. al. 

Find Configs, Scripts, Evals here.

MaChAmp is being run in Google Colab, if you want to rebuild the results it is recommended to use at least Colab Pro and adapt the code (paths) to personal preferences.

Cheers,
Xaver
